My name is Ryan Riebau. I was born and grew up in Florida, but currently live in Normal,Il with my partner.
I work full time in insurance as a claims specialist, and attend school at Loyola University Chicago.
I have two cats, Leone and Angus, who demand attention at all times of the day (including the middle of the night).
